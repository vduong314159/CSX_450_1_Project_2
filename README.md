## DOMAIN

 The problem is drawn from the analysis of wholesale customer data set.
 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
 We wish to perform exploratory data analysis and gain insights using clustering models. 

 
## DATASET AND INPUTS
 
 The dataset to be examined is the wholesale customers which consists of 440 customers and 8 variables (FRESH,MILK, GROCERY, FROZEN, DETERGENT_PAPERS, DELICASSEN, REGION, CHANNEL).
 
## SOLUTION STATEMANT
 
 A solution to this problem will be a KMeans and Hierarchical clustering model.

## BENCHMARK MODEL

 Unsupervised models can't be benchmarked.
 
## EVALUATION METRICS
 
 There aren't really evaluation metrics for exploratory data analysis.
